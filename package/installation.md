# Installation

If you have not already done so:
- Create an [account in AWS with full admin privileges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/setting-up.html).
- Download and install Python 3.7 and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). The instructions will make use of the cli command lines.

The recommended way to install Python is through [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)

[See here for the AWS CLI installation - version 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html)

Clone the repository to a folder on your local computer.

## Cloud Formation Set Up

The cloud formation templates can be found under package/cloudformation. You can run these in the CloudFormation GUI within your AWS console or by command lines. 

Before using any cloudformation template, create a separate folder for them and copy them from the git clone.
