# Section

The SECTION command will create a div within which other commands can be called. 
It requires an ID to be defined within double brackets. Commands syntax is also changed.

For example: 

    ///MAIN:
    %%SECTION::
    {{ section-id }}
    [%CONTENT:]
    TEXT=[  Something here etc ... ]:
    
Commands syntax is modified from %% :: to [% :]
